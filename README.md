# Hangman Game

## Description

Hangman is a simple command-line game implemented in PowerShell. The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game includes ASCII art for visual representation, tracks chosen letters, and handles illegal character inputs.

## Features

- ASCII art display representing the hangman and game state.
- Tracks chosen letters and displays which letters are in the word.
- Handles inputs to prevent multiple character inputs. Non-letter Characters are allowed, but this will soon be fixed.
- No retry function available yet due to technical issues.
